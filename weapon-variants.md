# Rare Weapon Variants

Each weapon class has multiple variants with different rarities and stats. This guide covers how to obtain rare variants.

## Understanding Variants

When you craft a weapon, you don't just get the base type - you have chances for different **variants**:

- **Common (1/1)** - The standard version
- **Uncommon (1/2 to 1/4)** - Slightly better stats
- **Rare (1/8 to 1/64)** - Significantly better stats

## Variant Drops by Class

### Daggers

| Variant         | Chance | Notes        |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Dagger          | 1/1    | Base variant |
| Falchion Knife  | 1/2    |              |
| Gladius Daggers | 1/4    |              |
| Hook            | 1/16   | **Rare**     |

### Straight Swords (Light)

| Variant        | Chance | Notes        |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Falchion Sword | 1/1    | Base variant |
| Gladius Sword  | 1/2    |              |
| Cutlass        | 1/4    |              |
| Rapier         | 1/8    |              |
| Chaos          | 1/64   | **Rare**     |

> **Tip:** Rare variants have the same ore requirements as common ones - it's all about luck!

## Maximizing Your Chances

The variant roll is **independent** of your ore quality. Whether you use Iron or Divine ores, you have the same chance for rare variants.

However, using better ores means your rare variant will have:

- Higher base damage
- Better multiplier bonus
- More valuable traits

## Farming Strategy

1. Use the calculator to hit exact ore requirements
2. Mix in high-rarity ores for better stats
3. Craft repeatedly for rare variant chances
4. Track your drops to understand probabilities
