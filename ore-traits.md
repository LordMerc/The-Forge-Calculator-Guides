# Complete Ore Traits Guide

Every ore in The Forge can grant unique traits to your crafted items. This guide covers all available traits.

## How Traits Work

Traits are special bonuses that get applied to your weapon or armor based on the ores you use:

- Each ore has a unique trait
- Ore must be **10% or more** of total to apply its trait
- Multiple traits can stack from different ores
