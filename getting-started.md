# Getting Started with Forging

Welcome to The Forge! This guide will help you understand the basics of crafting weapons and armor.

## Understanding Ores

Ores are the foundation of all crafting in The Forge. Each ore has:

- **Rarity** - From Common to Divine
- **Multiplier** - Affects final weapon/armor stats
- **Traits** - Special bonuses that can be applied

> **Tip:** Higher rarity ores have better multipliers, but are harder to find!

## Ore Rarities

| Rarity    | Multiplier Range | Example Ores               |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| Common    | 0.2x - 0.35x     | Stone, Iron, Copper        |
| Uncommon  | 0.4x - 1.3x      | Silver, Gold, Titanium     |
| Rare      | 0.8x - 2.25x     | Quartz, Diamond, Sapphire  |
| Epic      | 1.0x - 3.4x      | Obsidian, Ruby, Emerald    |
| Legendary | 3.0x - 5.25x     | Mythril, Fireite, Magmaite |
| Mythical  | 5.5x - 7.5x      | Demonite, Darkryte         |
| Divine    | 11.5x            | Galaxite                   |

## Your First Weapon

To craft a weapon:

1. Select your ores in the calculator
2. Set the amounts for each ore
3. Choose "Weapon" as the craft type
4. View your chances for each weapon class

### Ore Requirements

Different weapon types require different amounts of ore:

- **Daggers** - 3 ore (minimum)
- **Straight Swords** - 7 ore
- **Katanas** - 12 ore
- **Great Swords** - 16 ore
- **Colossal Swords** - 30 ore

## Traits

Each ore can grant a special **trait** to your weapon. For a trait to be applied:

- The ore must make up at least **10%** of your total ore count
- Multiple traits can be applied from different ores

> **Pro Tip:** Mix ores strategically to get the traits you want while maximizing your multiplier!

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. Experiment with different ore combinations
2. Try crafting armor for defensive bonuses
3. Learn about rare weapon variants

Good luck, smith! 🔨
